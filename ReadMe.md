### Object Oriented Programming 
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure and organize code 
- Allow modularization 
- Allow Reusability 
- Allow Scalability

### Class : 
A blueprint for creating objects (instances)
A class will define , attributes(data) and methods(functions) thats the object will have

### Object :
An instance of a class 

Car (attributes)  : Class 
 - color , model , registration , yom , wheels , size , transmission


## Principles of OOP 
 - Inheritance : allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from another class 
 - Encapsulation : bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a class
 - Polymorphism  : means many forms and is used to perform a single action in different ways
 - Abstraction : exposing what is only essential
